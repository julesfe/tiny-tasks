# TinyTasks

Welcome to _TinyTasks_, the most basic task management app in the whole wide world - no fancy UI, no mobile view, a very limited set of features and an even more limited set of tests. Fortunately, you are here to save the day and improve parts of _TinyTasks_. Feel free to focus on a single feature or aspect of the application. Here are some ideas if you don't know where to start:

* __Feature improvements:__
   - a user can mark tasks as done
   - a user can assign due dates
   - a user can assign priorities
   - a user can add categories
   - a user can sort the list of tasks
   - a user can search for a specific task
   - a user can add a description for a task
   - a user can use markdown
   - a user's tasks are persisted in the browser's storage
   - ...
* __UI improvements:__
   - improve the overall design
   - improve the UI of an existing feature
   - add a mobile view
   - add mobile gesture support
   - ...
* __Structural improvements:__
   - improve or introduce domain models
   - improve the existing code structure
   - add unit tests for existing features
   - add e2e tests for existing features
   - ...

As you can see, there is loads of stuff to be done. Just pick one of the ideas above or surprise us with one of your own improvements. Also, do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any problems. We are here to help.

You can simply create a new branch and start working on _TinyTasks_. Feel free to create a pull request if you would like to see your changes merged into the application. Want to keep the changes to yourself? Not a problem - just bring them with you when we catch up.
